This a web application for manage stock market data and visualization of data.This application divided into two section.
One work on JSON data and another work on SQL data.It has CRUD functionality for maintain data.For visualization it has line chart and combined bar/line chart.

Technology Used:
1)ASP.NET Core
2)JavaScript
3)Chart.js
4)EntityFrameworkCore
5)MySQL

Techique Used:
1)JSON Serialization
2)Repository Pattern
3)Unit of Work

I learned lots of things while doing this project such as, how to use Chart.js library,data visualization,handle and serialize json data in .NET Core 
and i also learned some data access logic.

Previously, i didn't work on how to use JSON as static database and CRUD operation,Serialization on JSON.So this was challanging for me.
Hopefully i have done this properly.
